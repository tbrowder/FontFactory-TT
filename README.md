NAME
====

**FontFactory** - Provides functions to ease using Unicode *TrueType*, *OpenType*, and *Type 1* fonts with *PDF-generating* modules. 

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use FontFactory;
...to be completed...
```

Installation
============

First, ensure your host has the `fontconfig` and `freetype` system libraries installed. Then, before installing this module, you should add any additional desired fonts such those available as packages for your system (for example, the Google Noto fonts are available in Debian package `fonts-noto`).

To get all the Google fonts, download them in a single, 1.1 Gb file: `wget https://github.com/google/fonts/archive/main.zip`. Then, as root, move the file into the recommended directory and unpack it:

    # mv main.zip /usr/local/share/fonts
    # cd /usr/local/share/fonts
    # unzip main.zip
    ...
    # rm main.zip
    # find . -type f -exec chmod -R 644 {} \;
    # fc-cache

To get a look at how your fonts appear when printed, install the program `fntsample` (Debian package name is the same) and use it with a desired font file name to get a detailed sample on an output PDF file. See [https://fntsample.sourceforge.net](https://fntsample.sourceforge.net) for details.

When you are satisfied with your font collection, proceed with `zef install FontFactory`.

Font licenses
-------------

Fonts installed on most systems are usually free for personal use, but may have restrictions for other uses. Please ensure you adhere to those requirements.

Font lists
----------

### System fonts

To use this module, you must first generate a list of all the TrueType, OpenType, and Type 1 fonts available on your system. The only directories searched are the following:

  * /usr/share/fonts

  * /usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1

  * /usr/share/X11/fonts/TTF

  * /usr/local/share/fonts

That search is automatically accomplished during the installation by `zef` in its build step. The list will be stored in your `$HOME` directory as `$HOME/.fontfactory/system-fonts.list`. That file looks something like this:

    # font-name location
    Blarney.ttf /usr/src/fonts/
      #... more entries
    Courier.otf /usr/local/fonts/
      #... more entries

Note that all instances of the same font will be listed and you can edit the file to delete unwanted duplicates. That list is for your reference and is not used by this module.

If for some reason (such as adding new fonts or deleting some) you want to reinitialize the list, uninstall this module and reinstall it.

### User fonts

For convenience you may want to create a another list to associate your oft-used fonts with a short alias. That is done by creating a file named `$HOME/.fontfactory/my-fonts.list`.

The file should look something like this:

    # a valid data line contains three fields (words separated by one or more spaces):
    #   1. alias 
    #   2. font-name (with extension)
    #   3. location (path)
    # all data on a line after the third field are ignored
    # blank or comment lines like this are ignored
      100   Blarney.ttf   ~/.fonts    my favorite serif font
      c     Courier.otf   /some/dir   my favorite monospaced font
      p     Pocus.ttf     /some/dir   my favorite sans serif font
      s     Scroll.otf    /some/dir   best for Jewish calendars

Note the fields **alias**, **font-name**, and **location** (parent directory) are required. The **alias** is some key you want to use to refer to that font. (This directory will be searched before the system directories and its alias will override any identical system font alias.) The **font-name** must include the suffix ('.otf', '.ttf', or '.t1'). The **notes** field is optional. 

DESCRIPTION
===========

**FontFactory** is a Unicode font factory similar to `FontFactory::Type1` but using *TrueType*, *OpenType*, and *Type 1* fonts. It rovides functions to ease using Unicode fonts with *PDF-generating* modules. It does that by defining a font class that includes a specific font face and size along with functions emulating those found in *Font::AFM*.
