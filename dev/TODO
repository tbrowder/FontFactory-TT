Design, improve, and document better the FF object

The goal is to produce a final product providing the aome of the same
methods as FontFactory::Type1 plus any additional methods that may be
available from David Warren's Font::FreeType module.

For the 'set-font-size' routine we only need to set the width in
points for outline use. We can also set width different than size for
special effects:

See lib/Font/FreeType/Face.rakumod:
    method set-font-size(Numeric $width, Numeric $height = $width,
                        Uint $horiz-res = 0, UInt $vert-res = 0) {

Create a method to use ligatures if available (file issue with Font::FreeType)

Document the practical uses:

+ given a font, size, and a string, print a line of text for ordinary use
  DONE

+ given a font and size, print the first N printable glyphs

+ given a font, size, and a list of unicode points (in hex or decimal),
    print the results
