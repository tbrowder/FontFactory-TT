The 'MICR Encoding' font for bank checks was obtained from 1001fonts.com:
  https://www.1001fonts.com/micr-encoding-font.html

The downloaded file was named 'micr-encoding.zip' (which was deleted
after unzipping it).

When file 'micr-encoding.zip' was unzipped into the 'unzipped'
directory, the following files were found:

  '!DigitalGraphicLabs.html'
  '!license.txt'
  micrenc.ttf

The two files in single quotes were renamed to:

  DigitalGraphicLabs.html
  license.txt

The license basically says the font is free to use for non-commercial purposes.
