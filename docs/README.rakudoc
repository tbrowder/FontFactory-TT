=head1 NAME

B<FontFactory::TT> - A Unicode font factory similar to C<FontFactory::Type1> but
using TruType fonts.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use FontFactory::TT;

=end code

=head1 Installation

To use this module, you must first generate a list of all the TrueType and OpenType fonts
available on your system. That is normally automatically accomplished during the first
installation by C<zef> in its build step. The list will be stored in your C<$HOME>
directory as C<$HOME/.fontfactory-tt/system-fonts.list>.
That file looks like this:

=begin code
# font-name location
Blarney.ttf /usr/src/fonts/Blarney.ttf
...
Courier.otf /use/local/fonts/Courier.otf
=end code

If that step fails, or for some reason (such as adding new fonts) you want to
reinitialize the list, run C<ff-reload>. 

For convenience you may want to create a another list to associate your oft-used fonts
with a short alias. That is done by creating a file named
C<$HOME/.fontfactory-tt/my-fonts.list>.

The file should look like this:

=begin code
# alias font-name     notes
  1     Blarney.ttf   my favorite serif font
  m     Courier.otf   my favorite monospaced font
  n     Pocus.ttf     my favorite sans serif font
  j     Scroll.otf    best for Jewish calendars
=end code

collect all fonts you wish to
use into one directory. Then assign an alias for each as a shortcut
to the file or font name. These steps can be done with the help
of several included programs:

=item find-fonts.raku
