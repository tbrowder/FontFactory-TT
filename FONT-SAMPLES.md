Languages for font samples
==========================

I am collecting suggested lines of text for publishing font samples in languages other than English. The contributed examples should be submitted as an issue at [https://github.com/tbrowder/FontFactory](https://github.com/tbrowder/FontFactory). The first contributer for a given language will be considered authoritative and must provide suitable contact data (a Github repo reference owned by the contributer is acceptable).

The data submitted should include the two-letter ISO code for the language along with the contributer's desired name for attribution. The submitter can also suggest his or her favorite font (which must be free; a link to a source is required).

The default text for a given language is (as suggested by \@patrickb on IRC \#raku) a 'pangram' from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram#) as referenced in the following table. A more complete list is at <Clagnut.com|https:/clagnut.com/blog/2380/#Sample_font_displays_in_other_languages_using_pangrams>.
