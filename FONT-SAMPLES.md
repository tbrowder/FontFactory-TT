Languages for font samples
==========================

I am collecting suggested lines of text for publishing font samples in languages other than English. The contributed examples should be submitted as an issue at [https://github.com/tbrowder/FontFactory](https://github.com/tbrowder/FontFactory).

The data submitted should include the two-letter ISO code for the language along with the contributer's desired name for attribution.

The default text for a given language is (as suggested by \@patrickb on IRC \#raku) is a 'pangram' from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram#) as referenced in the following table.

<table class="pod-table">
<caption>Pangrams by language code</caption>
<thead><tr>
<th>Code</th> <th>Pangram</th> <th>Notes</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr> <td>EN</td> <td>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.</td> <td></td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
