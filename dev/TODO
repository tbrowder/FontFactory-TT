Design, improve, and document better the FF object

The goal is to produce a final product providing the
same methods as FontFactory::Type1 plus any
additional methods that may be available from
David Warren's Font::FreeType module.

Use my FontFactory::Type1 and URWBookman-Demi
fonts (.otf, .t1, .afm) as the primary check 
for data consistency for this module.

For the 'set-font-size' routine we only need to set
the width in points for outline use. We can also
set width different than size for special effects:

See lib/Font/FreeType/Face.rakumod:
    method set-font-size(Numeric $width, Numeric $height = $width,
                        Uint $horiz-res = 0, UInt $vert-res = 0) {
