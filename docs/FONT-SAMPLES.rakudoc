=head1 Languages for font samples

I am collecting suggested lines of text for
publishing font samples in languages other
than English. The contributed examples
should be submitted as an issue at L<https://github.com/tbrowder/FontFactory>.
The first contributer for a given language will be considered authoritative
and must provide suitable contact data (a Github repo reference owned by
the contributer is acceptable).

The data submitted should include the two-letter ISO
code for the language along with the contributer's
desired name for attribution. The submitter can also suggest his
or her favorite font (which must be free; a link to a source is required).

The default text for a given language is (as suggested by \@patrickb on IRC \#raku)
a 'pangram' from L<Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram#> as referenced
in the following table.
A more complete list is at <Clagnut.com|https:/clagnut.com/blog/2380/#Sample_font_displays_in_other_languages_using_pangrams>.
