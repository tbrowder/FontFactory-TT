Reorganize the font handling.

After much experimenting, I think the best
way to organize the fonts are into two lists.

List creation with Build
------------------------

The static arrays created in $HOME/.fontfactory/system-fonts.list 
will contain lines like this:

  basename directory [KERN if True]

The format of the user's file, 'my-fonts.list', will be slightly
different:

  basename directory notes (which may contain KERN)

When creating a FontFactory object, the two lists will be 
combined, but any user fonts found in the system fonts
list will be eliminated. The combined list will be
sorted alpabetically by basename.
The user font lines will have its lines look like this:

  basename directory [KERN if True] [USER if True] [any notes]


Showing fonts
-------------

When showing the fonts, the list will look like this:

  [list index + 1] basename [KERN if True] [USER if True] [any notes]

Finding fonts
-------------

The user can search by:

  "index" numbers [indexed from one as shown]
  patterns [non-case sensitive pieces of a basename]

All matches result in the same format as "Showing fonts."

Using a font
------------

The user selects an index number, a size, and a desired reference name. 
The index number and size are used to create a DocFont object.
