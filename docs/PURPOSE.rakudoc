=head1 Purpose

This module was designed so the author can manage fonts
and use them to create PDF documents using PDF::Lite.

PDF::Lite can handle typesetting painlessly but the
author likes to have more control over the process
of placing text on a blank page.

The process goes something like this:

=item Select fonts using FF

=item Select paper size and orientation

=item Start writing...

=begin code
=end code
